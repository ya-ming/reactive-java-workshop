# Reactive Programming

## Why?
* Compare to concurrency APIs (Future and CompletatbleFuture)
    * Much simpler than the manual concurrent way
    * Few reusable flexible functions
    * Combine and reuse in powerful ways

## Stream
* Represent a sequence of data
* Focus on computations
* vs collections which focus on storage
* Internal iteration

* Operators
    * map
    * filter
    * flatMap
    * findFirst
    * ... and many more
